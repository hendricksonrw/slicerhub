Slicerhub requires several things to be installed in order to get everything
up and running.

1. First you need to install the python libraries using pip -r install requirements.txt
2. install mongodb using the script or check to see if there is a new version.
3. install RabbitMQ Server and configure a user for the celery user to use
	see: http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/getting-started/brokers/rabbitmq.htm


Configuration

Right now how exaclty everything gets configured is still in development.
Essentially there will be these things that need to be configured

Celery 

in slicebase.celerystalk.celeryconfig
Define your message broker and your user settings to 
use RabbitMQ as your message broker

DB - MongoDB
Right now the data model uses MongoDB for persistance.
I have yet to define where the user/pass and the default database should be.
